Switch to Octopress
===================

My WordPress site has been hacked one too many times, and I'm a little tired of it. So, starting today, I'm creating this dev blog in Octopress instead, and hosting it on GitHub. Should make things run a lot smoother, and I *shouldn't* have to worry about it getting hacked any longer.
