Octopress has been great, but Seth Warbuton ([@nternetinspired](http://twitter.com/nternetinspired)) has convinced me to go with straight Jekyll instead. His JekyllMe base site made it so easy, and it's fast as hell. It's a win no matter what was you look at it.

Now, to just port in my octopress posts. Problem is, it looks like they remove the Markdown version after converting it to html. (madface)
